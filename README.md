3. The second player does the same.
4. Capturing when possible is mandatory: ALL pieces that cannot be captured are darkened leaving you the possibility of capturing an opponent's pawn

5. When a piece reaches the end of the opponent's board, the pawn automatically becomes a queen. A queen has a better range of motion. (Pawns are not blocked when she can capture).
